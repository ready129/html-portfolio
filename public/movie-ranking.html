<h1>The best movies according to ME!</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all time.</h2>
<hr />

<h3>Parasyte</h3>
<p>One of my first Japanese movies. Suspensful and kept me on my toes.</p>

<h3>Lala Land</h3>
<p>It was realistic, showing that you can be in love with the right person, but at the wrong time.</p>

<h3> Fight Club</h3>
<p>I really enjoyed the twist at the end. <br/>
    I really like how I can just break this paragraph <br/>
    and still let it be connected for example right now this will go on until <br/>
    now. It's to practice. Now let me put a line <hr/>
    See pretty cool huh?
